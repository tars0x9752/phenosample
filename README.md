# npm-typescript-package-starter

A personal TypeScript package starter with yarn berry 2 boilerplate.

## Includes

- Prettier
- ESLint
- Jest

## What to do first

~~Install devDependencies with the command `yarn install`~~.

Actually, No. This template uses yarn v2 Plug'n'Play which means initial `yarn install` is no longer necessary.

And, Don't forget to enter the `name`, `description` and `repository.url` into package.json. Once you've done that, you can start writing code. 👍
